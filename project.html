            <h2> Béaute Website </h2>
            <p> My first ever completed and published website. I made it on December 2020, it was quite challenging but I am happy with the outcomes. 
                I hope this website could help us, especially woman, to understand the best way to take care of our selves and become more confident :D

            <h2> Studee Prototype  </h2>
            <p> Besides website, I tried to learn UI/UX design on December 2021 and finally made a prototype for an app called Studee. During this pandemic, students can easily
                get distracted and hard to stay focus in maintaining their school performance, So, my friend and I made this app. We hope this app could help students to manage
                their time.

            <h2> Femindex (Hackathon) </h2>
            <p>My first every hackathon held by The Superpotion of Toronto, Canada. I worked with 3 other people from the United States and successfully made "Femindex" </p>
