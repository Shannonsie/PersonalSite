            <p> I made this website by myself, but I also looked at some references. The theme of this website is space,
                I want to be able to shine as bright as the stars, and become like a stars who can make everyone feel happy and amazed
                when they look at it. The girl in the drawing (using my school's uniform) represents a 
                brave soul that is not hesitate to explore the world. </p>

            <p> Hi everyone! Thank you for coming to this website. <br> I am Shannon, a senior high school student from Santa Ursula Senior High School Jakarta, Indonesia. 
                Besides school, I am also a ballet dancer and a leader in an organization. This year, I will be graduation from senior high school and 
                planning to continue my undergraduate degree in computer science major. I have been learning coding since I was in elementary school and fell in love with it, especially
                HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Other than than, I have learned a little about python and mySQL. The most interesting thing for me is making website! I have made a few websites, and this is one of them. I make this portfolio website as a place for me to express myself. In this site, there are projects that I have done, my contact, my photos as a ballet dancer, and
                many more.   <br> <br> If you want to know me more,
                do not hesitate to <b> contact me!</b>  <br> </p>
